Use Case 1: _____________
If the use case was an ML problem....

1) What is being predicted?

2) What data is needed?

Now imagine the ML problem is a question of software:

3) What is the API for the problem during prediction?

4) Who will use this service? How are they doing it today?

Lastly, cast it in the framework of a data problem. What are some key actions to collect, analyze, predict, and react to the data/predictions (different input features might require different actions)

5) What data are we analyzing?

6) What data are we predicting?

7) What data are we reacting to?
